Firefox extension that adds Brave Search to Firefox and includes `@brave`, `!brave`, `@b`, and `!b` as search keywords. This allows you to easily search brave in multiple new ways.

[![Get the Addon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semanticdata/text-revealer-firefox-extension/master/firefox.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brave-search-and-keyword/)

## Examples

- `!b !w Hello World` would let you search Wikipedia directly from any website regardless or wether or not you set Brave as your default search provider.
- `!gh Zola themes` would let you search GitHub directly while having this extension enabled.

## ⚠ Disclaimers

This extension is an independent project. It has no relation, and is not affiliated to Brave in any way. Brave™ is a registered trademark of Brave Software, Inc.

After some research, it appears Mozilla has placed limitations on using `chrome_settings_overrides` on Android. This is necessary to assign a new search engine under the platform.
