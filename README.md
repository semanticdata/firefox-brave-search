Brave Search Engine and Keywords
</h1>

Firefox extension adds Brave Search to Firefox and includes `@brave`, `!brave`, `@b`, and `!b` as search keywords. This allows you to easily search brave in multiple new ways.

### Examples

- `!b !w Hello World` would let you search Wikipedia directly from any website regardless or wether or not you set Brave as your default search provider.
- `!gh Zola themes` would let you search GitHub directly while having this extension enabled.
