# Brave Search Engine and Keywords

Firefox Extension adds Brave Search to Firefox and includes `@brave`, `!brave`, `@b`, and `!b` as search keywords.
This allows you to easily search brave in multiple new ways.

Example: `!b !w Hello World` would let you search Wikipedia directly from any website regardless or wether or not you set Brave as your default search provider.
